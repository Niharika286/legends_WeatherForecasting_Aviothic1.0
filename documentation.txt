from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim:
 Imports the Nominatim class from the geopy.geocoders module for geocoding location data.

from tkinter import ttk, messagebox: 
Imports specific classes from the Tkinter module for advanced widgets and message boxes.

from timezonefinder import TimezoneFinder:

from PIL import Image, ImageTk: 
Imports classes from the PIL module for working with images.
Initializing the Tkinter root window:

root = Tk(): 
Creates the root window for the application.
Various settings are configured for the root window, such as title, geometry, background color, and resizing options.
Defining the getWeather function:

This function is called when the user clicks the search button.
It retrieves weather information based on the city entered by the user.
The function uses various APIs and modules to fetch and process weather data, including geolocation, timezone, and weather forecast.
The weather details are extracted from the JSON response obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Creating and placing various widgets:

Labels, buttons, entry fields, and images are created and placed on the Tkinter window to create the user interface.
Images are loaded using the PhotoImage class from the PIL module.

The place() method is used to specify the coordinates for placing the widgets on the window.
Displaying weather details:

Labels (label1, label2, etc.) are created to display temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and description.
Additional labels (t, h, p, etc.) are created to display the actual weather values.
The values are updated inside the getWeather function using the retrieved JSON data.
